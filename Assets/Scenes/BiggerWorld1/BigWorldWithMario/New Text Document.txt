AllThatISNeedWorking is the last version in this folder:
All zombies are grabbable, can resume or stop movement
audio works fine as camera gets near or not...probably just change radius a little
Two new characters are working fine too...can be grabbed and moved, resume animation

Next Folder: test6
Either implement next 30%
Or work on Main Menu
